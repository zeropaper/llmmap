They are often compared to tuples and offer value semantics, providing benefits such as read-only access, const correctness, and persistence. Immutable records can be found in object-oriented programming as well, offering an alternative to traditional mutable objects."},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":108,"total_tokens":219,"completion_tokens":111}}
