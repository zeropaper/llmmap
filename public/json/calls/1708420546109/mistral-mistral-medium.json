A topological space is a set endowed with a structure, called a topology, which allows defining continuous deformation of subspaces, and, more generally, all kinds of continuity. A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space. A homeomorphism is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse function. A continuous function is a function between topological spaces that preserves continuity. An open set is a set that is a neighborhood of all its points. A closed set is the complement of an open set. A compact space is a topological space in which every open cover has a finite subcover. A connected space is a topological space that cannot be represented as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. A homotopy is a continuous deformation between two continuous functions. A topological invariant is a property of a topological space that is preserved under homeomorphisms."},"finish_reason":"stop","logprobs":null}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":106,"total_tokens":341,"completion_tokens":235}}
