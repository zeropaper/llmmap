Karl Popper: He was the philosopher who introduced the concept of falsification principle.\n2. Scientific method: The falsification principle is a part of the scientific method, which suggests that a theory should be testable and falsifiable.\n3. Empirical evidence: The falsification principle relies on empirical evidence to test a theory.\n4. Theory testing: The falsification principle suggests that a theory should be subjected to testing to see if it can be falsified.\n5. Hypothesis testing: The falsification principle is used to test specific hypotheses.\n6. Critical rationalism: The falsification principle is a key concept in critical rationalism, which suggests that all knowledge is open to revision.\n7. Inductive reasoning: The falsification principle is a reaction against inductive reasoning, which suggests that theories can be confirmed by evidence.\n8. Problem of demarcation: The falsification principle is used to address the problem of demarcation, which is the question of what distinguishes science from non-science.\n9. Philosophy of science: The falsification principle is an important concept in the philosophy of science.\n10. Verificationism: The falsification principle is a reaction against verificationism, which suggests that a theory is only meaningful if it can be verified."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":109,"total_tokens":461,"completion_tokens":352}}
