It is often used to describe situations in which the full impact of an action is not immediately apparent, but becomes clearer over time as the ripples spread outward. Other terms related to the ripple effect include causality, which refers to the relationship between cause and effect, and the domino effect, which is a specific type of ripple effect in which one event triggers a chain reaction of related events. The butterfly effect is another related concept that describes how small initial changes can have large and unpredictable effects over time. The multiplier effect is an economic concept that describes how a change in spending can lead to a larger change in economic output. Systemic change refers to changes that affect an entire system or structure, rather than just individual parts.","tool_calls":null},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":109,"total_tokens":340,"completion_tokens":231}}
